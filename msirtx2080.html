    <p id="paragraph" >The GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is an enthusiast-class graphics card by NVIDIA, launched on September 20th, 2018. Built on the 12 nm process, and based on the TU102 graphics processor, in its TU102-300A-K1-A1 variant, the card supports DirectX 12 Ultimate. This ensures that all modern games will run on GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. Additionally, the DirectX 12 Ultimate capability guarantees support for hardware-raytracing, variable-rate shading and more, in upcoming video games. The TU102 graphics processor is a large chip with a die area of 754 mmÂ² and 18,600 million transistors. Unlike the fully unlocked GeForce RTX 2080 Ti 12 GB, which uses the same GPU but has all 4608 shaders enabled, NVIDIA has disabled some shading units on the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti to reach the product's target shader count. It features 4352 shading units, 272 texture mapping units, and 88 ROPs. Also included are 544 tensor cores which help improve the speed of machine learning applications. The card also has 68 raytracing acceleration cores. NVIDIA has paired 11 GB GDDR6 memory with the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, which are connected using a 352-bit memory interface. The GPU is operating at a frequency of 1350 MHz, which can be boosted up to 1545 MHz, memory is running at 1750 MHz (14 Gbps effective).
        Being a dual-slot card, the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti draws power from 2x 8-pin power connectors, with power draw rated at 250 W maximum. Display outputs include: 1x HDMI 2.0, 3x DisplayPort 1.4a, 1x USB Type-C. GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is connected to the rest of the system using a PCI-Express 3.0 x16 interface. The card's dimensions are 267 mm x 116 mm x 35 mm, and it features a dual-slot cooling solution. Its price at launch was 999 US Dollars..</p>
